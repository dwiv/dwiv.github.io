  <h3>Re: Dover Cliff university application</h3>
  Dear Dover, <br />
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's
  <a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/">iSchool</a> to study for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your
  questions one by one, in the following sections.
  <p>
    <h4>Starting dates</h4>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us
    at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
    beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><time datetime="2019-08-29">First semester: 29 August 2019</time></li>
      <li><time datetime="2020-01-22">Second semester: 22 January 2020 </time></li>
      <li><time datetime="2020-05-02">Third semester: 2 May 2020</time></li>
    </ul>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which
    start date you would prefer. You can find more information about important
    university dates on our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
    At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research
    facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of
    information studies. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
    and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of
    the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order
    of priority:
    <ol>
      <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) Measuring the effect on
        performance of funk bassplayers at</li>
      <li>temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
        exponentially</li>
      <li>increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></li>
      <li>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more
    information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else
    you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
  </p>

    <h4>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h4>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my
    post-doctorate work, I did study animals. To answer your question, my
    favourite creatures are as follows, with definitions:
    <dl>
      <dt>The Canadian Polar</dt>
      <dd>bear A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on
        seal. </dd>
      <dt>The elk </dt>
      <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the
        mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and
        also frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts. </dd>
      <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
      <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe
        eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is
        instead the call of the red-tail. For more of my research, see my research
        page.</dd>
    </dl>

  Yours sincerely, <br /><br />
